## What

This project intends to make it very easy to push your changes to the Kubernetes
source code into a cluster.

It uses [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/) to create the different clusters,
and allows you to have different cluster [profiles](profiles).

The idea behind this project is to create a base box that downloads all the
required dependencies. This way, it's possible to completely remove network
latency (or work completely offline if required) from your workflow.

The idea is to also automate the whole process completely, allowing for the
automation to be disabled in case you as a Kubernetes developer want to perform
some steps manually.

You can push your changes on the Kubernetes source code to the cluster when you
are creating the cluster, or when it's already running.

Both single master and multi master deployments are supported. In the multi
master deployment case, a load balancer will be created in a separate machine.

It's also possible to run several clusters at the same time, as long as they are
different profiles and their cluster and/or machine names don't clash, as well
as the IP addresses assigned to them.

## Requirements

* [Virtualbox](https://www.virtualbox.org/)
* [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/)
* Kubernetes cloned under `$GOPATH/src/k8s.io/kubernetes`

## Quick start

You only need to have cloned Kubernetes in your $GOPATH in your host. The path
should be `$GOPATH/src/k8s.io/kubernetes`. Let's create the Kubernetes
artifacts first:

```
~/p/kubernetes-cluster-vagrant (master) > make artifacts

<snip>

INFO: Elapsed time: 68.716s, Critical Path: 38.72s
INFO: 60 processes: 60 processwrapper-sandbox.
INFO: Build completed successfully, 61 total actions
```

Now let's create a 1 master and 1 worker cluster:

```
~/p/kubernetes-cluster-vagrant (master) > PROFILE=bootstrap/1-master-1-worker make

<snip>

>>> kubeconfig written to /home/ereslibre/.kube/config
```

Now you can execute from your host directly:

```
~/p/kubernetes-cluster-vagrant (master) > kubectl get nodes
NAME      STATUS    ROLES     AGE       VERSION
master    Ready     master    79s       v1.14.0-alpha.0.974+f89aa180476882
worker    Ready     <none>    41s       v1.14.0-alpha.0.974+f89aa180476882
```

Now, let's clean the cluster machines and the container used for building the
Kubernetes artifacts:

```
~/p/kubernetes-cluster-vagrant (master) > PROFILE=bootstrap/1-master-1-worker make clean
```

## Building Kubernetes artifacts

This project can help you to build Kubernetes artifacts with a single command,
it's handy if you don't want to leave this directory. The tasks created by this
project will launch bazel in a container in your host. This container will be
kept running so we leave the bazel instance running inside the container.

If you need to modify autogenerated files bazel won't do this for you, so in
this case you still need to go to your `$GOPATH/src/k8s.io/kubernetes` and run
a regular `make` command to regenerate the autogenerated files.

Within this project directory you can run several targets in order for artifacts
to be recreated:

* `make debs`
  * Will regenerate the debs based targets:
    * `cri-tools`
    * `kubeadm`
    * `kubectl`
    * `kubelet`
    * `kubernetes-cni`

* `make images`
  * Will regenerate the container images targets:
    * `kube-apiserver`
    * `kube-controller-manager`
    * `kube-proxy`
    * `kube-scheduler`

* `make artifacts`
  * Will run:
    * `make debs`
    * `make images`

After you have generated the artifacts you can read how to create a cluster
using these artifacts or how to deploy them on an already running cluster:

* [Building a cluster](#building-a-cluster)
* [Deploying changes to the cluster while it's running](#deploying-changes-to-the-cluster-while-its-running)

## Base box

The base box will contain some general images that will be used later when
creating the cluster. These images are defined in
[`container_images.json`](base-box/configs/container_images.json). At the
moment they are:

* `coredns`
* `etcd`
* `flannel`
* `pause`

Also, the following images inside
`$GOPATH/src/k8s.io/kubernetes/bazel-bin/build` (created manually or by running
`make images` within this project) are also copied and loaded in the base box:

* `kube-apiserver`
* `kube-controller-manager`
* `kube-proxy`
* `kube-scheduler`

Aside from that, the following packages inside
`$GOPATH/src/k8s.io/kubernetes/bazel-bin/build/debs` (created manually or by
running `make debs` within this project) are copied and installed in the base
box too:

* `cri-tools`
* `kubeadm`
* `kubectl`
* `kubelet`
* `kubernetes-cni`

Building the base box requires internet connection for installing some packages
and the first set of containers (the ones defined in
[`container_images.json`](base-box/configs/container_images.json)).

Once the base box is built, it is saved as a Vagrant box named
`kubernetes-vagrant`.

The idea behind the base box is that it contains everything needed to bring up
a cluster in an offline environment, so if you are temporarily working on slow
networks it won't affect your workflow.

When you create a cluster, you can override whatever you want (e.g. `kubeadm`
and `kubelet` packages), that will be installed on top of the ones included by
the base box. This allows you to create clusters faster, only installing the
packages you modified and checking the results.

From time to time you'll need to rebuild the base box, but it's an action that
you won't perform nearly as often as creating machines for testing your changes
on the Kubernetes source code.

## Building a cluster

Building a cluster is trivial, all you need is to point to a specific profile.
Take into account that this process is completely offline and doesn't need to
download any information from the internet.

You can just run `make` with the `PROFILE` envvar set to a profile name that
exists inside the [profiles](profiles) folder, or to a full path containing
the profile you want.

```
~/p/kubernetes-cluster-vagrant (master) > time PROFILE=bootstrap/1-master-1-worker make
make -C base-box
make[1]: Entering directory '/home/ereslibre/projects/kubernetes-cluster-vagrant/base-box'
>>> Base box (kubernetes-vagrant) already exists, skipping build
make[1]: Leaving directory '/home/ereslibre/projects/kubernetes-cluster-vagrant/base-box'
vagrant up
Bringing machine 'kubernetes_master' up with 'virtualbox' provider...
Bringing machine 'kubernetes_worker' up with 'virtualbox' provider...

<snip>

>>> kubeconfig written to /home/ereslibre/.kube/config
9.30user 4.82system 2:14.49elapsed 10%CPU (0avgtext+0avgdata 64236maxresident)k
0inputs+584outputs (0major+690067minor)pagefaults 0swaps
```

Now you can execute from your host directly:

```
~/p/kubernetes-cluster-vagrant (master) > kubectl get nodes
NAME      STATUS    ROLES     AGE       VERSION
master    Ready     master    74s       v1.14.0-alpha.0.756+51453a31317118
worker    Ready     <none>    16s       v1.14.0-alpha.0.756+51453a31317118
```

This will use all the versions of packages and components present in the base
box, what might not be what you are looking for, since your local changes to
Kubernetes weren't pushed, because on the `make` command we didn't specify
`PACKAGES`, `IMAGES` or `MANIFESTS` environment variables, so the ones from the
base box were used.

Everything that you want to deploy to the cluster can be controlled by
environment variables. The currently supported ones are:

* `PACKAGES`
  * `cri-tools`
  * `kubeadm`
  * `kubectl`
  * `kubelet`
  * `kubernetes-cni`
* `IMAGES`
  * `kube-apiserver`
  * `kube-controller-manager`
  * `kube-proxy`
  * `kube-scheduler`
* `MANIFESTS`
  * `flannel`

It's possible to start the cluster and make it use your recently built component
versions. You just need to provide what `PACKAGES`, `IMAGES` or `MANIFESTS`
you want to be deployed when the cluster is created. For example:

```
~/p/kubernetes-cluster-vagrant (master) > PROFILE=bootstrap/1-master-1-worker PACKAGES=kubeadm,kubelet make
```

In this case, it doesn't matter what versions of `kubeadm` and `kubelet`
existed on the base box, the ones that you built on the host will be transferred
to the different cluster machines and installed as soon as the machines are up.

In the case that you are using a profile that is bootstrapping the cluster
automatically, this bootstrap will happen after the new packages have overriden
the old ones.

## Deploying changes to the cluster while it's running

`vagrant provision` can be used to deploy different things to the cluster. As
with a regular `vagrant up` (or `make`), you can also use `PACKAGES`,
`IMAGES` and `MANIFESTS` environment variables at will, to control what to
deploy.

## HA deployments (multi master)

Multi master deployments are supported, and are as simple as setting the correct
profile. Example:

```
~/p/kubernetes-cluster-vagrant (master) > time PROFILE=bootstrap/3-masters-1-worker make

<snip>

>>> kubeconfig written to /home/ereslibre/.kube/config
22.03user 12.93system 4:27.33elapsed 13%CPU (0avgtext+0avgdata 80360maxresident)k
0inputs+1376outputs (0major+1914771minor)pagefaults 0swaps
```

From your host, now you can run:

```
~/p/kubernetes-cluster-vagrant (master) > kubectl get nodes
NAME      STATUS    ROLES     AGE       VERSION
master1   Ready     master    3m4s      v1.14.0-alpha.0.1058+73b9effcb6dab5

```

```

A load balancer (haproxy) will be created, what will be the entry point for all
master node apiservers. The `kubeconfig` file that will get generated in your
`$HOME/.kube/config` will include the reference to this load balancer IP
address.

## SSH'ing into the machines

You can use `vagrant ssh` normally, but you need to point to the `PROFILE` in
order to refer into what machine you want to SSH into. If you have created a
cluster with, say:

```
~/p/kubernetes-cluster-vagrant (master) > PROFILE=bootstrap/1-master-1-worker make
```

Then, you can ssh into two machines, named: `master` or `worker`, as the
profile shows. So, you can do:

```
~/p/kubernetes-cluster-vagrant (master) > PROFILE=bootstrap/1-master-1-worker vagrant ssh kubernetes_master
```

```
~/p/kubernetes-cluster-vagrant (master) > PROFILE=bootstrap/1-master-1-worker vagrant ssh kubernetes_worker
```

Take into account that the prefix is the name of the cluster also present in the
`PROFILE` file.

## Destroying the cluster

You can destroy the cluster by pointing to the profile using the `PROFILE`
environment variable and calling to `make clean`. This will also clean up your
`~/.kube` folder on the host.

```
~/p/kubernetes-cluster-vagrant (master) > PROFILE=bootstrap/1-master-1-worker make clean
vagrant destroy -f
==> kubernetes_worker: Forcing shutdown of VM...
==> kubernetes_worker: Destroying VM and associated drives...
==> kubernetes_master: Forcing shutdown of VM...
==> kubernetes_master: Destroying VM and associated drives...
```

In case you also ran `make images`, `make debs` or `make artifacts`,
`make clean` will also remove the docker container created to build kubernetes
artifacts.

If you want to destroy the cluster, but keep the docker container for building
Kubernetes artifacts faster, you can run `make destroy`.

## Executing any bazel target

It's possible to call any bazel task within the Kubernetes build container, like:

```
make bazel WHAT="test //cmd/kubeadm/..."
```
